# Chatbot_PersonalProject
Coding Challenge as part of my application to Codeworks.me on Dec 27th, 2021.

The following Chatbot is designed to meet the following requirements:
- On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages.
- The screen should automatically flow and follow the messages posted, like in all chat apps.
- Each message should have an indication of the date and time it was sent.
- Your CSS needs to be clean.
- Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript and jQuery.
